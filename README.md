# Matlab-improc-nn

Here you can find a number of image processing and neural network projects that I coded in Matlab.

## Project descriptions

I will briefly describe all of the projects/folders in this repo. Folders not mentioned are unfinished or obsolete.

### ML_ex folder

This folder contains examples from the coursera machine learning course, partially completed by me.

### data_sets folder

Here you can find a number of datasets created with the [Protein Simulation & Structure search program](https://github.com/ricsinaruto/ProteinStructureSearch-Simulation). These datasets were used to explore how nerual networks could be used to find protein logic structures. In each folder you can find a script used to train a neural network and the dataset used as well as screenshots of results. For further information I suggest the readme of the linked repository and [this paper](https://ricsinaruto.github.io/website/docs/tdk.pdf).

### image_proc_HW folder

Here you can find my homework for a university image processing course. I created and trained a simple neural network on the notMNIST dataset to distinguish between 10 characters (A-J). The resulting neural network can be found in neural_net.m. You can try out the network with your own images using the evaluate.m script. The function expects as input an image and returns the predicted output class.

### image_processing folder

Here you can find a ton of image processing scripts that I coded during a university course.
