Matlab image processing and neural network projects  
  
ML_ex containts machine learning examples for the coursera machine learning course  
  
In the data_sets folder there are a number of data sets created with the  
  dronpa simulation program found here (https://ricsinaruto.github.io/website/)  
  These data sets were used to explore how neural networks could help find useful molecular structures  
  
In image_processing and image_proc_HW are projects and notes from a university image processing course  
  
Other folders are incomplete
